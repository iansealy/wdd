<h1>WDD2 Assignment</h1>

<p>You will be assessed on the basis of this assignment. Your work will be presented on paper for assessment. This assignment should be between 3000 and 4000 words.</p>

<p>The assignment will involve the production of a detailed functional specification document for your project, describing:</p>

<ul>
<li>user and business requirements</li>
<li>the proposed information architecture</li>
<li>your chosen method(s) of evaluation</li>
<li>your project plan and costing</li>
</ul>

<p><b>You need to:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>demonstrate that you have a clear understanding of user-centred design, information architecture and web usability</li>
<li>build a strong design rationale by showing evidence of original user research, evaluation and iterations in design that address the findings of the research and evaluation</li>
<li>critically discuss and correctly reference your source materials</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage, you <b>do not need to:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Present graphical design of the website</li>
<li>Include code, or present your assignment in html</li>
<li>Discuss activities you've done that do not demonstrate the application of user-centred design principles</li>
<li>Discuss topics assessed in other modules (coding, image manipulation)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end product you put forward for assessment should already be fully reviewed by you (and others if appropriate) for accuracy, consistency and completeness. It should therefore be in a form that presents a professional approach – well presented, succinct and lacking in ambiguity.</p>

<p><b>Topics to cover:</b></p>

<p><b>User research and business objectives</b><br />
Explain the business objectives for your chosen project. Describe your target users and their needs. Critically discuss your approach to user research in contrast to other methods. Explain how you aim to bring user needs and business objectives together as an overall value proposition and specific site goals.</p>

<p><b>Design</b><br />
Document the proposed information architecture of your site by using appropriate techniques, showing the overall structure (site map), specific task flows as well as the individual pages (wireframes).  Critically discuss how you solved the design problem on a conceptual as well as a detailed level. Justify your solution both in terms of user needs and usability principles. Define content requirements, technical requirements and write a short design brief.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation</b><br />
Describe how evaluated your design and critically discuss your chosen approach and its relative strengths and weaknesses in contrast to other methods. Describe, discuss and prioritise your findings and show how they will be reflected in the final design. 
You may chose to evaluate your design with users, or use an inspection technique. Either way, you need to explain and justify your approach considering the theoretical background as well as the practical application.</p>

<p><b>Project planning</b><br />
Including a high level project plan that describes the different project activities and timeframes, resources, and costs.</p>
