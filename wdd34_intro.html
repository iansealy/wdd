<h1>Where does usability fit into the development lifecycle?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Everywhere!  Usability engineering is <strong>iterative</strong> - should be applied throughout lifecyle</li>
</ul>

<h1>Definition of usability</h1>
<p>A usable interface (e.g. for a website) has multiple components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learnability</strong> - should be easy to learn</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - should be productive</li>
<li><strong>Memorability</strong> - should be easy to remember so that user can return later and not have to re-learn</li>
<li><strong>Errors</strong> - should have a low error rate</li>
<li><strong>Satisfaction</strong> - should be pleasant to use</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>What are the benefits of usability?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The benefits of usability shouldn't be underestimated; in some user interfaces (e.g. flight cockpits) it can be the difference between life and death</li>
<li>On the web, it can mean huge benefits in terms of revenues, repeat visits, customer satisfaction, efficiency etc.</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">

<h1>Thinking about ROI</h1>

<p>ROI = Return on Investment</a>

<ul>
<li>Business Problem</li>
<li>User Behavior</li>
<li>Behavior Metric</li>
<li>Value Metric</li>
<li>Financial Metric</li>

</ul>

</div>

<div class="slide">

<h1>An Example Problem</h1>

<p>600 users each make one error daily whilst filling in an online form.  The error takes five minutes (on average) for users to correct. A revision of the user interface can prevent this error - A freelancer has quoted &pound;3000 to fix this in 1 week.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">

<h1>The Calculation</h1>

<ul>
<li>600 workers * 5 minutes saved each day = 3000 min saved / day</li>
<li>3000 min/day * 300 working days per year = 900 000 min saved /year</li>
<li>Average worker salary of &pound;20 per hour = &pound; 0.33  per min</li>
<li>&pound; 0.33 per min * 900000 min =  &pound; 297 000 saved every year</li>
<li>Worth the one off fee of  &pound; 3000 ?????  Massive R.O.I</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="slide">

<h1>The Calculation - breakdown</h1>

<ul>
<li>Business Problem - Improve online form efficiency</li>
<li>Desired Behavior - User Completes online form</li>
<li>Behavior Metric - Forms completed without errors</li>
<li>Value Metric - Minutes saved per year</li>
<li>Financial Metric - min saved * (salary/min) = &pound; saved</li>
</ul>

<h1>The ROI of usability : some examples</h1>

<p>ROI = Return on Investment</a>

<ul>
<li>"A financial services company had to scrap an application it had developed, when, shortly before implementation, developers doing a User Acceptance test found a fatal flaw in their assumptions about how data would be entered. By this time, it was too late to change the underlying structure, and the application never implemented."  (Dray, 1995)</li>
<li>"After move.com completed the redesign of the home "search" and "contact an agent" features based on a UI consulting firm's recommendations, users ability to find a home increased from 62% to 98%, sales lead generation to real estate agents increased over 150%, and [move.com's] ability to sell advertising space on move.com improved significantly."  (Vividence, 2001)</li>
<li>"IBM's Web presence has traditionally been made up of a difficult-to-navigate labyrinth of disparate subsites, but a redesign made it more cohesive and user-friendly. According to IBM, the massive redesign effort quickly paid dividends. The company said in the month after the February 1999 re-launch that traffic to the Shop IBM online store increased 120 percent, and sales went up 400 percent." (Battey, 1999)</li>
</ul>

<h1>The ROI of usability : some more examples</h1>


<li>"More than 83 percent of Internet users are likely to leave a Web site if they feel they have to make too many clicks to find what they're looking for, according to Andersen's latest Internet survey." (Arthur Andersen, 2001)</li>
<li>"To build a model intranet, Bay Networks spent $3 million and two years studying the different ways people think about the same thing. The result: all think alike about the $10 million saved each year." (Fabris, 1999)</li>
<li>"A study from Zona Research found that 62% of Web shoppers have given up looking for the item they wanted to buy online (and 20% had given up more than three times during a two-month period)." (Nielsen, October 1998)</li>

<h1>Summary of usability benefits</h1>

<p>Usable sites have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decreased learning time</li>
  <li>increased efficiency</li>
  <li>decreased error rates</li>
  <li>increased user enjoyment and trust e.g <a href="http://www.webcredibility.org/guidelines/">Stanford Web Credibility</a></li>

</ul>

<p>This leads to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased competitive advantage</li>
  <li>improved customer satisfaction</li>
  <li>improved brand image</li>
  <li>improved user productivity</li>
