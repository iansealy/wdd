<h1>Ergonomics and Cognetics</h1>

<h2><strong>Ergonomics</strong></h2>
<p>Design guidelines for products that interact with us physically, e.g. knee chairs, ergonomic mice.</p>
<h2><strong>Cognetics</strong></h2>
<p>Design guidelines for products that interact with us mentally, e.g. Web sites!</p>
<p>We have to understand psychologically what humans can and can't do</p>

<h1>The locus of attention</h1>

<p><strong>Attention</strong> is an important psychological concept. You can only concentrate on (or &quot;attend to&quot;) a small amount of the information that your sense organs pick up. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cocktail party effect: You don't listen to other people's conversations, but if your name is mentioned you hear it!</li>
<li>The sound of a dripping tap: Annoying to start with, but your brain eventually filters it out so that it's not part of your &quot;locus of attention&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can't take in <strong>all</strong> information on a page simultaneously, so need to do it sequentially. This can be thought of as a &quot;spotlight of attention&quot;.</p>

<h1>Eye tracking</h1>
<p>It's useful to be able to understand the way that users look at a Web page. This can be done via eye tracking studies.</p>

<h1>Eye tracking: findings</h1>

<ul>
<li>Users look at text before graphics</li>
<li>Novice users tend to scan the Web like a book (start at top, then left-right scanning)</li>
<li>More experienced users go &quot;middle-left-right&quot; (the meat's in the middle!)</li>
<li>Users tend to read pages in a F-shaped pattern</li>
</ul>

<h1>Formation of habits</h1>
        
<ul>
  <li>Can distinguish between &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;unconscious&quot; actions</li>
  <li>Conscious actions occur in novel situations where problems need to be solved</li>
  <li>Conscious actions become more unconscious with experience: we form habits, e.g. driving a car, buying a book from Amazon</li>
  <li>Interface habits are inevitable, so try to take advantage of them, e.g. look to top left-hand corner of page for link to home</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Interference</h1>
       
<ul>
<li>You can't (easily) concentrate on 2 conscious things at once!</li>
<li>As stress or confusion increases, people concentrate more and more on fewer features</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Visibility and affordances</h1>

<ul>
<li>Should be clear what features are available and how they are operated</li>
<li>Visible means accessible to a human sense organ</li>
<li>If an interface forces you to memorise the fact that a feature exists, it is invisible</li>
<li>The method of operation (or &quot;actionable properties&quot;) should also be apparent</li>
<li>These are <strong>affordances</strong>. e.g. blue underlined words (hyperlinks) afford clicking</li>
</ul>

<h1>Fitts' Law</h1>

<ul>
<li>The time taken to move a cursor to a target depends on the distance to the target and its size</li>
<li>Example: The menu bar on a Mac and on a PC - the menu items on the Mac are at the screen boundary, so their effective size is bigger</li>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://fww.few.vu.nl/hci/interactive/fitts/">interactive demonstration of Fitts Law</a>, and an account of how it was used to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/08/22/711808.aspx">guide some of the design of Microsoft Office 2007</a></p>

<h1>Hicks' Law</h1>

<p>When you choose among a number of alternatives, the time to choose depends on the logarithm of the number of choices. For example, it becomes quicker to choose once from 8 items than from four items twice</p>
<p><img src="uploads/wdd3/wdd34/log.gif" alt="log relationship between number of options and search time" /></p>
<p>When you add page loading time, it often becomes much quicker to have more options (hence the preponderance of &quot;information-dense&quot; Web sites around! e.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">www.bbc.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/">www.tiscali.co.uk</a>)</p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Task</h1>
<p>Interpret the following sites in terms of the psychological principles just described. In particular, ask yourself:</p>
<p>Where is your attention directed? What affordances are there? Are there places where affordances could be better?</p>
