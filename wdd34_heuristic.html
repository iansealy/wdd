<h2>Usability heuristics</h2>

<h1>Usability heuristics</h1>

<p>What is a heuristic?</p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Nielsen's classification of usability heuristics</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">Nielsen's heuristics</a> provide 10 general usability principals for ANY interactive system. (not just websites!)</p>

</div>
<div class="slide">
    
<h1>1. Visibility of system status</h1>
     
<ul>
<li>Inform the user what the system is doing (e.g. navigation, confirmation of a purchase, changes in state)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: Warning messages (&quot;are you sure?&quot;), status bars for site loading (&quot;percent downloaded&quot; better than &quot;Loading...&quot;)</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.expedia.co.uk/">www.expedia.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.play.com">http://www.play.com</a></p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>2. Match between system and real world</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Speak the user's language</li>
    <li>Don't use non-standard meanings</li>
    <li>View interactions from user's perspective (e.g. &quot;you have bought...&quot;, rather than &quot;we have sold you...&quot;)</li>
    <li>Make use of mental models (based on task analysis) or use appropriate metaphors (such as "shopping cart")</li>
  </ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>3. User control and freedom</h1>

<ul>
<li>Users don't like to feel trapped, e.g. in a sequence of steps (registration or shopping cart)</li>
<li>Don't force new windows on users; let them choose! <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200603/the_target_attribute_and_opening_new_windows/">Discussion!</a></li>
<li>Also, good navigation (Where can I go? Always provide a link to home page in case they get lost)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>4. Consistency &amp; standards</h1>
       <ul>
    <li>Basic usability principle</li>
    <li>Same info should be presented in same location on all pages &amp; formatted in the same way. <a href="http://www.ocean-estate.co.uk/ocean/">ocean letting example</a></li>
    <li>This includes functionality as well as screen design, e.g. shopping baskets ought to all work in a similar manner </li>
  </ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>5. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors</h1>
        
<ul>
  <li>Should be phrased in clear language and avoid obscure codes (e.g. the notorious Error 404!)</li>
  <li>Should be precise, e.g. instead of &quot;cannot open this document&quot;, &quot;Cannot open Chapter 5.doc because this file does not exist&quot; might be more informative</li>
  <li>Should be constructive, e.g. add &quot;search your computer for this file&quot; to the above example</li>
  <li>Should be polite and not intimidate the user, e.g. &quot;ILLEGAL USER ACTION, JOB ABORTED!&quot;</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>6. Error prevention</h1>
        
<ul>
  <li>Even better than having good error messages is preventing them in the first place</li>
  <li>Avoid errors by doing lots of testing!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/073571410X/iansealycom">Defensive Design</a>.</p>


</div>
<div class="slide">

        <h1>7. Recognition rather than recall</h1>
        
<ul>
<li>Easier to recognise information than remember it (e.g. when learning a language, passive vocabulary is much larger than active vocabulary)</li>
<li>Get user to choose between clear options, e.g. entering date in a form</li>
<li>Use generic commands (e.g. File&gt;Open, common labelling schemes such as &quot;about us&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;), which promote cross-site / cross-application learning</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>8. Flexibility and ease of use</h1>
        
<ul>
<li>&quot;Accelerators&quot; make it easy for users to carry out certain tasks, e.g. function keys, contextual menus, bookmarks, "Remember Me" login options</li>
<li>Shortcuts also important in accessibility - can be added using <a href="http://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol4/accessibility_no19.htm">&quot;accesskey&quot; attribute</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of accelerators include &quot;Ctrl-C&quot; (copy) in Windows and Amazon's &quot;1-click ordering&quot;.</p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>9. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h1>
        
  <ul>
    <li>Simplify as much as possible</li>
    <li>Understand users' mental models</li>
    <li>Make navigation simple</li>
    <li>Follow <a href="http://www.usask.ca/education/coursework/skaalid/theory/gestalt/gestalt.htm">&quot;Gestalt&quot;</a> principles such as closure, similarity and proximity</li>
    <li>Avoid <i>extraneous</i> information</li>
  </ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>10. Help and documentation</h1>

  <ul>
  <li>Ideal system has no need for help, as it is 100% intuitive!</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, most users don't read help</li>
  <li>When they do, though, provide a good, task-oriented search and integrate documentation within your site</li>
<li>Also, put links to help where users will look for them, preferably in the "locus of attention"; this is <strong>contextual help</strong>.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Heuristics</h1>
        
<ul>
<li><strong>Generic Usability Heuristics</strong> - Nielsen's heuristics provide a very useful overview but are not specific to web design (this is also their strength)</li>
<li><strong>Heuristics for Web Systems</strong><a href="http://usability.gov/guidelines/">Research-based web design and usability guidelines</a> provides an excellent set of guidelines, including references and a &quot;strength of evidence&quot; indicator!</li>

</div>

<div class="slide">

<h1>Don't forget why we are doing this!</h1>
        
<ul>
<li>Good usability often goes unnoticed - it just seems like common sense.</li>
<li>Bad usability is easy to notice.  Resist the temptation to blame users rather than the system!</li>

<div class="slide">

<h1>Heuristic evalution</h1>

<p>The goal is to find the usability problems in a user interface design.  This is best done by several experts, but general approach can be used by anyone to assess the usability of a site.  This 
method is also known as an <strong>expert evaluation</strong> or a <strong>usability review</strong>.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://www.webmasterbase.com/article/520">Heuristic Evaluation - a Step By Step Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_evaluation.html">How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation</a></p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
<li>Determine what you are going to evaluate (e.g. paper prototype, HTML prototype, existing website)</li>
<li>Select the evaluators. Ideally, 3 or more usability experts (the more experienced the better)</li>
<li>Do the evaluation</li>
<li>Compile results &amp; deliver summary report</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>The evaluation</h1>

<ul>
<li>Look for areas of confusion or where they feel users might potentially be confused</li>
<li>Each assessor should assess the site in isolation</li>
<li>Can be useful to go through the site in two ways (i) a general browse, (ii) task-specific</li>
<li>Each problem should also be assigned a <i>severity rating</i> in order to prioritise usability problems

<ul>
<li><strong>Severity 1</strong>: Cosmetic problem - need not be fixed unless extra time is available on the project</li>
<li><strong>Severity 2</strong>: Minor problem - should be fixed, but low priority</li>
<li><strong>Severity 3</strong>: Major problem - important to fix and should be given high priority</li>
<li><strong>Severity 4</strong>: Usability catastrophe - imperative to fix this!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Compiling the results</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sort each problem by a severity rating</li>
<li>Classify problems according to Nielsen's heuristics</li>
<li>Discuss results with other evaluators</li>
<li>Deliver a summary report.  Be positive and constructive! Phrase the report in terms of design improvements rather than being overly critical</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">

<h1>Limitations of heuristic evaluation</h1>
        
<ul>
  <li>Only one of many techniques</li>
  <li>Ideally requires several experts</li>
  <li>Not particularly systematic (although individual evaluators may have a personal systematic approach)</li>
  <li>Doesn't involve real users; still a second-guess, although based on well-known and well-established usability heuristics</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Task</h1>
       
<p>You play the role of a usability expert. Carry out a heuristic analysis of <a href="http://www.thepsychometricscentre.org/">the psychometrics centre</a>
</p>

<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Base your analysis on existing usability checklists, such as those at <a href="http://www.bunnyfoot.com/freestuff/articles/usability/usabilitychecklist.html">Bunnyfoot</a> and <a href="http://usability.gov/guidelines/">Usability.gov</a> (NOTE that these are by no means exhaustive)</li>
  <li>Try a 2-step approach: 1. get an overall feel for the site. 2. put yourself in the mind of a potential user and try to carry out what you consider to be important tasks for the site.</li>
  <li>Try to classify your usability findings into meaningful groups. e.g. you could try putting them into Nielsen's categories, or the site may suggest a different grouping to you.</li>
  <li>AFTER you have done this, get together with one of your esteemed usability colleagues(!) to discuss your findings. How does your evaluation differ from theirs?</li>
