<h1>User Analysis</h1>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Who are your users?</h1>
        
<ul>
  <li>YOU ARE NOT YOUR USERS - so don't automatically assume that you know exactly what they want!</li>
  <li>In which case... WHO the heck are they?</li>
  <li>Initial business analysis usually identifies the <strong>general</strong> types of user</li>
  <li>In a business context, marketing departments often have a good overview of users</li>
  <li>We need to find out more detail, though</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">


  <h1>What can we find out about them?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Social and economic factors</li>
      <li>Skill levels (expert or novice?)</li>
      <li>Environments (connection speed / browser / hardware / shared or exclusive 
        use?)</li>
      <li>Likes and dislikes</li>
      <li>Product usage patterns &amp; product-related desires</li>
      <li>Vocabulary / language</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...a combination of intelligent guesswork and research, combined with <strong>iterative design</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Getting into the minds of your users</h1>
        
<ul>
    <li>To design an effective web site that meets the needs of your users, you'll 
      need to get into the minds of your users</li>
<li>You therefore need to do some <em>research</em></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Four questions we can ask about our users</h1>

<ul>
   <li>What do users <em>need</em>? (conceptual understanding of primary user tasks)</li>
   <li>What do users <em>want</em>? (user preferences)</li>
   <li>What do users <em>do</em>? (user behaviors)</li>
   <li>What do users <em>feel</em>? (emotional responses)</li>
</ul>

  <p>Our aim is to develop a <strong>mental model</strong> of our users and the 
    way they carry out their tasks.</p>

<p>Initially, focusing on what users <strong>need</strong> and what they <strong>do</strong> is more productive than asking users what they <strong>want</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>User research methods</h1>

<p>Ideally, you need to interact with your users and find out about them!  Research methods include...</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Contextual enquiry &amp; observational analysis</li>
    <li>Interviews &amp; questionnaires</li>
    <li>Emotional response testing</li>
    <li>Many more... eg. <a href="http://jthom.best.vwh.net/usability/">Usability Methods Toolbox (inquiry section)</a> or within <a href="http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/list.htm">UsabilityNet: Methods List</a></li>
  </ul>

</div>
<div class="slide">

<h1>Contextual Enquiry</h1>

<ul>
  <li>An observational technique that involves watching users work in a natural context (hence the name!)</li>
  <li>The aim is to see <strong>what users actually do</strong>, rather than getting them to <em>say what they think they do</em></li>
  <li>Adopt a master-apprentice relationship (you are the apprentice)</li>
  <li>Interview subject after observational period</li>
</ul>

    enquiry at the Usability Methods Toolbox</a></p>

  <h1>Contextual Enquiry Example</h1>

  <p> A secretary usually provides information for clients via the phone. You 
    are asked to design a web interface to assist them in providing this information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What sources of information does (s)he use? Paper-based (phone book, post-it notes)? Computer-based
   (spreadsheet, simple Web site)?</li>
  <li>What are the most common tasks that the secretary carries out?</li>
  <li>What sources of difficulty does (s)he encounter?</li>
  <li>What sort of information does the secretary provide? Do they have a particular terminology that (s)he uses?</li>
  <li>Does (s)he need to phone other people to find out?</li>
  </ul>

<p>The goal is to understand how the secretary thinks in order to be able to support him/her in achieving his/her goals.</p>

  <h1>Task</h1>
        
<ul>
    <li>Work in pairs. One person is the observer. The other must perform a task. 
      Toss a coin if you can't decide.</li>
    <li>The task is to find the stock quote and EPIC symbol (you'll have to find 
      out what this is, if you're not sure) for the pharmaceutical company <strong>Phytopharm</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you find this too easy, spend a little time trying to work out a fiendishly 
      difficult task to set your partner!</li>
    <li>The observer should carefully watch the other person performing the task 
      and take notes.</li>
    <li>The person performing the task should try to explain what they are thinking 
      (&quot;think aloud protocol&quot;) as they try to complete the task.</li>
    <li>At the end of the task, discuss with each other your perceptions of the 
      task. Was the observer surprised by the approach? How did your mental models 
      differ? </li>
  </ul>

<p>If you have time, try repeating the exercise. This time, swap roles and make up your own task.</p>

<h1>Interviews &amp; questionnaires</h1>
        
  <ul>
    <li>Useful techniques for understanding how users think</li>
    <li>May be face-to-face or remote</li>
    <li>Could be very specific (e.g. task related) or very general (general user 
      opinions), depending on the project.</li>
    <li>Needs to be done with <strong>representative</strong> users</li>
    <li>Need a relaxed atmosphere and environment for face-to-face interviews</li>
    <li>You should also <strong>structure</strong> the interview as much as possible, 
      but still try to retain flexibility</li>
  </ul>

<p>One of the main problems with any technique that involves asking people's opinions directly is that they don't always do what they say they do! A combination of observation <em>and</em> interviews may be more illuminating.</p>

<h1>Interviews &amp; Questionnaires 1</h1>
 
<p><strong>Advantages of User Interviews</strong></p>       
  <ul>
             <li>Straight from the horses mouth!</li>
	      <li>Can be guided/exploratory</li>

<h1>Interviews &amp; Questionnaires 2</h1>
 
<p><strong>Disadvantages of User Interviews</strong></p> 
<ul>
      <li>Time consuming to arrange, conduct, document (scribe!) and interpret</li>
      <li>Need to conduct lots to achieve a representative sample user population</li>
      <li>Difficult to ensure all appropriate questions are asked</li>
      <li>Interviewer Bias</li>
      <li>Fear of getting in trouble! - explain your purpose</li>
      <li>People don't always do what they say they do! A combination of observation <em>and</em> interviews may be more illuminating.</li>

<h1>Interviews &amp; Questionnaires 4</h1>
 
<p><strong>Disadvantages of User Questionnaires</strong></p> 
<ul>
<li>Bias</li>
<li>Difficult to guide or direct</li>
<li>People who actually bother to fill out voluntary questionnaires are often not representative users!</li>
<li>Very difficult to design a “good” questionnaire</li>

<li>Do you always do it this way? Or have you tried other ways in the past?</li>
<li>What makes it difficult to achieve your aims?</li>
<li>What makes it easy for you to do this?</li>

<h1>Emotional response testing 1</h1>

  <p>You can get your users to assess the <strong>personality</strong> an existing 
    web site (or a competitor web sites) by asking them to rate the site on a 
    number of emotional scales. For example, from the redesign of the BBC Web 
    site....</p>
<p><img src="uploads/wdd3/wdd32/bbcemotion.gif" alt="bipolar emotional plot for BBC Web redesign" /></p>
<p>Similar techniques are outlined in more detail in Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/usability/UEPostings/DesirabilityToolkit.doc">Desirability Toolkit</a> (Word document).</p>

<h1>Emotional response testing 2</h1>

  <p>BERTs can help provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fingerprint for your site/product/competitor site/graphic design concept/prototype....!</li>
<li>A comparison between the intended perception of a site <em>[business stakeholders view]</em> with the site's actual perception </em>[users view]</em>.</li>
<li>Feedback on how a site fits within company brand values <em>[the fingerprint of the organisation]</em></li>
<li>Feedback on graphical design concepts/prototypes before build or provide useful feedback on the completed site</li>
